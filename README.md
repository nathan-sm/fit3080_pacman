# Assignment 1

This is your personal Git repository for assignment 1. It contains all the code you need.

Please only edit the following files:

- `agents/q2Agent.py`
- `problems/q1a_problem.py`
- `problems/q1b_problem.py`
- `problems/q1c_problem.py`
- `solvers/q1a_solver.py`
- `solvers/q1b_solver.py`
- `solvers/q1c_solver.py`

Other files will not be seen in the automatic grading system.

To use Git, you can use the `git` command in the terminal or [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) if you prefer a GUI. Once ready for grading, push your code to your Github repo and click the Evaluate My Code button in the grading portal. The grading system will pull your code from your repo and run the evaluation.
